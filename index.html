      <h1>I am ignorant.</h1>
      <p>I know that’s not something most people would brag about. But wearing that ignorance on my sleeve has been the key to any successes I’ve had as a designer. No, I do not have all the answers, and I’m not going to pretend that I do.</p>
      <p>I’m quick to claim my ignorance because I’m more interested in starting with the right questions than jumping into a quick solution. I strive to <strong>question everything.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>But what is it that I do, exactly?</strong> For over ten years I’ve been helping build brands, develop strategies, create identities and user interfaces, write copy, and lots of fiddling with interactions and responsive design to get things just right. To do these things I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, pre-processors, task-runners, static site generators, git, GitHub, and an ever-changing list of many other tools.</p>
      <p>I’m currently the Design Developer at <a href="https://twilio.com">Twilio</a>. Which means I focus on the intersection between design and code. Some personal projects include <a href="https://jamiewilson.io/predawn/">Predawn</a> and <a href="https://norwester.pro/">Norwester</a>.
